## Overview

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Spatial-extremes**: Uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic precipitation data for extreme weather events, aiding climate risk assessment.
2. **Hydrological Modelling**: Simulates water flow and flood dynamics using shallow water equations on a 2D grid, suitable for flood modeling and hydrological studies.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Estimates direct water damage to buildings from flooding, providing a tool for assessing financial impacts.
