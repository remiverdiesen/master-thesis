# Spatial Extremes

Models complex spatial dependencies between climate extremes in different locations. With the evtGAN, we show that combining extreme value theory (evt) with a deep learning model (generative adversarial networks (GAN)) can well represent complex spatial dependencies between precipitation extremes. Hence, instead of running expensive climate models, the approach can be used to sample many instances of spatially cooccurring extremes with realistic dependence structure, which may be used for climate risk modeling and stress testing of climate-sensitive systems.
